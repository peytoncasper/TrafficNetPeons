This section consists of an assessment of the following six components: scope analysis, research completed/remaining, technical analysis, cost analysis, resource analysis and schedule analysis in an attempt to critically analyze the feasibility of the successful fulfillment of the requirements specified herein.
\subsection{Scope Analysis}
The scope of work for all critical requirements is reasonable, but the prototyping of these by the deadline date may be the most challenging aspect of this project. I am confident however in the ability of this team to fulfill even this most chellenging element. This assessment is based on our research and understanding of the project completion requirements, as well as the experience provided us by Dr. McMurrough, who has been instrumental in aiding our progress thus far. We anticipate that three of the most crucial requirements will comprise the bulk of the work scope. These are{ }. Furthermore, it can be confidently stated that the addition of all remaining high priority criteria contributes little to the full scope of work for this project, so the probability of completing these remains high.
\subsection{Research}
With regards to this project, our research has spanned a broad spectrum of topics relative to the work scope associated with our project requirements. Thus far we have reviewed one closely similar open source project (http://www.sonsoftone.com/?page_id=287) which acomplished, relative to the project requirements stated here, a working full HD IP camera based on Raspberry Pi. In addition to this however, we have seen fit to research several topics not covered in the previous source. These topics include 
\subsection{Technical Analysis}

\subsection{Cost Analysis}

\subsection{Resource Analysis}

\subsection{Schedule Analysis}

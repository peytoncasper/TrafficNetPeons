This section provides the reader with an overview of the camera. The primary operational aspects of the camera, from the prospective of the end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the procuct as well as critical user interactions and user interfaces are described in detail.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The camera will be housed in a domed enclosure and two stepper motors, mounting bracket, Raspberry Pi Compute Module, and a Raspberry Pi Camera Module. As can be seen in Figure 1.1, The camera will be mounted on the top of a bracket with stepper motors attached at the joints to provide pan and tilt control. A Zoom and Day/Night lens will be attached to the Raspberry Pi Camera module and be connected to the Raspberry Pi for control.

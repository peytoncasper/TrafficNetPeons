The Detailed Design Specification (DDS) document will describe in detail the system architecture of the TrafficNet camera. The DDS will discuss the major components of the camera system and how they correspond to each other. The camera will have the ability to allow the user to view its stream and control the zoom, tilting, and panning aspects on a web interface. The camera will stream at least 10 FPS, include day/night control, maintain 10x zoom, be weather resistant, and will be powered from a solar panel and battery. The structure of the software system includes the web interface layer, wireless communication layer, base station layer, and camera layer. Each of these architectural layers include subsystems that have their own individual interfaces and interact with other subsystems.

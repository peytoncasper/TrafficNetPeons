The sponsoring company we are dealing with is TrafficNet. Ryan Guadagnolo from TrafficNet keeps close contact with Dr. McMurrough and our team. The scrum master would be the Kyle Edelmann, who ensures that the team is fully functional and productive, while also enables close cooperation across all roles and functions. The team member names are Jose Hernandez, Peyton Casper, Kyle Edelmann, Ruchitha Thalakola, and Rabin Dhaubanjar. The course leader would be Dr. McMurrough, who is in charge of gathering parts and helping the team make progress with the project.  The only responsibilities each team member has had so far is to finish the project charter tasks that were assigned to each team member. Since the project is at the early stages of development the team does not have concrete roles for each team member. Although some team members like Peyton and Kyle have taken the time to setup the Raspberry Pi which the team will need to begin testing. Once the team has the necessary materials and has everything setup to begin building the project, the team will begin assigning roles to each team member.

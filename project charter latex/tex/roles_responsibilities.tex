The sponsor company the team is collaborating with is TrafficNet. Ryan Guadagnolo is the product owner and the main contact from TrafficNet and keeps close contact with Dr. McMurrough and the team. The scrum master is Kyle Edelmann, who ensures that the team is fully functional and productive, while also enabling close cooperation across all roles and functions. The team members are Jose Hernandez, Peyton Casper, Kyle Edelmann, Ruchitha Thalakola, and Rabin Dhaubanjar. The course leader is 
Dr. Christopher McMurrough, who aids the team in making progress with the project. The only responsibilities each team member has had so far is to finish the project charter tasks that were assigned to each team member. Since the project is at the early stages of development the team does not have concrete roles for each team member. Although some team members like Peyton and Kyle have taken the time to setup the Raspberry Pi which the team will need to begin testing. Once the team has the necessary materials and has everything setup to begin building the project, the team will begin assigning roles to each team member.

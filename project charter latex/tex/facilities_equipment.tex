Most of our testing and team member meetings will be done at the senior design lab and at the FAB lab, where we have access to different type of tools. Some of the equipment that we will use for the project are a Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi camera, infrared camera, some type of surface mount which the team is still unsure of, Axis 214, stepper motors, solar panels, and battery. Since the project it at the early stages of development some of the equipment might change.

When finished, the system will run on very low power, have pan and tilt, have 180 degrees of visibility, have day and night capabilities, heating capabilities, easy to use GUI, and finally 10X zoom. To make the camera run on very low power we will use solar panels and batteries so that the power draw will be under 5W. The pan and tilt will be achieved by using stepper motors as suggested by Dr. McMurrough. The easy to use GUI and 10X zoom will all be controlled by the software, which we plan to use Linux as the operating system.

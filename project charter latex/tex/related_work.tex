The closest solution that exist would be the RaspberrIPCam. The RaspberrIPCam is an open source project that was built by Sons of Tone. The RaspberrIPCam streams in full HD (1080p) video streaming at 30fps, has RTSP protocol which is standard protocol for video streaming in security applications, and has web server configurations. Even though the RaspberrIPCam is close to what our project is, it stills lacks some additional features. One example would be that TrafficNet wanted the camera to have heating capabilities when bad weather was an issue, which the RaspberrIPCam does not have. Another requirement that TrafficNet wants is the camera to have a pan and tilt, which the RaspberrIPCam also does not have. Even though the RaspberrIPCam would serve as the closest solution, our team still needs to add additional features to meet the requirement from TrafficNet. \cite{SonsOfTone2014}.
